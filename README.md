In this project, we used a Jupyter Notebook to do all of your coding and written explanations. We preprocessed a dataset for handwritten digit recognition, built a neural network, then trained and tuned that neural network using your data.

The model achived high accuracy of 98%, and using different optimizer or different hyper parameterers didn't give any improvement on training the model.
